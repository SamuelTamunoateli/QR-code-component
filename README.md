## What I learned

I learnt how you can centralize an image and ensure it remains centered even though the window is resized.
Learnt how you can create variables in css and debugging your css code

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
:root{
    --first-colour: hsl(0, 12%, 23%);
    --debug: 1px solid red;
}
```
